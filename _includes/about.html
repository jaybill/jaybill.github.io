"<a href="http://jaybill.com">Jaybill</a> is just this guy, you know?"

<p>This isn't a blog in any traditional sense. It's a collection of stuff I wrote, most of it short and weird. Sometimes it's microbloggy sort of stuff, sometimes it's short fiction. It's a mixed bag, really. Maybe you'll dig it. I don't know. I can't keep up with you people anymore.</p>
