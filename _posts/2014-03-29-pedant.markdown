I didn't mean to, but it would seem I've become what can only be described as "an insufferable pedant". It started innocently enough. Any time anyone would post something fishy-sounding on a social network, I'd say to myself, "Self, this sounds fishy. Let's see if this article about vaccinations causing plane crashes my slother-in-friend twice removed just linked to holds up to the laziest level of research I'm willing to do." It doesn't, of course. I could forget about it and move on, but as the three seconds of googling I just did already landed me on the correct page of Snopes, it's not like it's difficult to paste that shit back into a comment and turn it into a teachable moment.

No one, and I mean *no one*, appreciates being proven wrong. I should know, I appreciate it less than most. Why do I insist on doing it to other people? I'm not helping anyone. People who will believe anything are going to continue to believe anything, and my link to an article debunking their claim that koalas are the leading cause of arthritis in children isn't going to change that. All I'm really doing is making someone feel dumb and making myself look like an asshole.

Has all this soul searching resulted in a change of heart? Will I stop replying to obvious bullshit with links to facts? Will I, in fact, ever stop being an insufferable pedant?

Not a chance. Control-V, motherfuckers.
