Food bloggers have made it impossible to get a decent recipe without twenty-seven artfully shot but completely useless pictures and a five thousand word back story about the writer's grandmother.

I just want to know what temperature to roast these chicken bones at for stock.  I better settle in, I have to read ten goddamn essays first.
